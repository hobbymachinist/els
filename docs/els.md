## Hardware

![](images/els.jpg)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

1. Ensure all signal cables are shielded.
2. Ensure the shielding is connected to ground at one end, close to the enclosure.
3. Ensure the enclosure is connected to power ground.
4. Always jog both axes to origin position (0, 0) before starting turning operations
    - This ensures any leadscrew backlash is taken care of in the lathe.
    - Allows the backlash compensation to kick in, ready for the turning steps.

### Kicad assets

All hw designs are done in Kicad 6.0.

- hw/els: The main board.
- hw/lcd: The LCD adapter for ILI9481 module

Optional extras:

- hw/buffer: Buffer and pulse shaper, helps keep the PUL signals going to the stepper drivers clean.
- hw/demo-driver: A standalone demo board with drv8825 for testing
- hw/power-clamp: Voltage clamp / suppression board.

### Main Board

Kicad files in hw/els

#### Active components

* Nucleo-F446RE https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html
* GL850G USB HUB Controller
* CH340C USB UART
* FT24C64A EEPROM

#### Solder Bridge Changes and Modifications Needed to Nucleo64 446RE

The Nucleo 64 is connected to the main board USB hub with a small cable. Nucleo 446RE will need a fair few
jumper changes and soldering to permit the firmware to use the required GPIO pins.

Refer to the GPIO pins listed below in the GPIO Map, the solder bridges for these pins should be setup correctly. See Nucleo 446RE
documentation UM1724, Section 6.9 on Solder Bridges for more details. A quick summary for jumper settings and changes I've made.

#### Using main board without USB hub & USB UART

The main board is primarily a breakout board for the Nucleo F446RE with a USB hub, USB USART controller
and additional terminal connectors. You can skip these (GL850G, CH340C and associated passives) and directly
wire PA9 and PA10 to the CN3 connectors marked RX and TX respectively. This will allow you to read the serial
comms via the onboard stlink CDC device.

The default UART baud rate in firmware is 921600, with 8 bits, no partity & 1 stop bit.

#### External Oscillator (HSE) on Nucleo 64

By default the firmware configures the clock to use the HSE. Nucleo 64 boards do not come with the crystal and passives
populated. Refer to UM1724 Section 6.7.1 for instructions on using HSE.

The following configuration is needed:
  - SB54 and SB55 OFF
  - R35 and R37 soldered
  - C33 and C34 soldered with 20 pF capacitors
  - SB16 and SB50 OFF

It's recommended to use an external crystal for better timing accuracy, but this is optional. If you want to use the
internal oscillator, set the `ELS_USE_HSE` directive to 0 in src/clock.c

#### EEPROM

This is again optional but without an external FT24C64A EEPROM, you will not be able to save the settings and the
defaults from constants.h will be used.

### TFT Breakout

Supported TFT 480x320 Displays

* ILI9481
* ILI9486
* ILI9488

* ILI9486, ILI9488 TFT, https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001288341298.html

Kicad files in hw/lcd

This primarily a carrier / breakout board with an IDC ribbon cable connector to main board. The main board is
connected to the LCD module using an adapter board that breaks out the pins to a 16 pin IDC socket.

### Output buffer / pulse shaper

Kicad files in hw/buffer

Optional add-on for cleaning up the high frequency pulses from the main board to the stepper drivers. This needs to be powered
separately and co-located with the stepper drivers. You may not need this depending on the length of the signal cables from
the main board to the stepper drivers.

* CD4050BE, non-inverting hex buffer.
* CRE1S0505SC, isolated dc-dc converter 5v.

### Keypad

I used this because I had an unused one left over from a different project that did not work out. They're not cheap but they're
very reliable and resistant to liquids in the workshop. The seller can also laser etch the art for keypads if you're interested.

#### Input without keypad

You can make do with this for trying out the firmware by using UART as an input. To do it, edit src/usart.c and set
`ELS_USART_ENABLE_KEYPAD_INPUT` to 1

### Encoder

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

The spindle encoder PPR, along with the gear ratio and pulses per MM for Z axis determines the maximum spindle RPM and
thread pitch you can turn in threading operations. There is currently no warning displayed if the spindle PPR is less
than the minimum required PPR.

### DRO

Supports TTL optical DROs and defaults to the commonly available 5uM resolution versions.

Most TTL optical DROs you get from China operate on a 5V logic level. You need to to get a DB9 panel or PCB socket (male)
and break out the 4 wires based on the wiring diagram for your DRO scale.

## Lathe Functions

The manual turning and threading functions do not control the X axis / cross slide but allows turning
and threading operations at a given feed / pitch to a given length.

The remaining functions are stepper / servo driven on both Z (longitudinal along bed) and X (cross slide) axis.

All function screens display the spindle status at the top

1. Clockwise / Counter clockwise direction of spindle and RPM. Chuck icon is shown when RPM = 0
2. Angular position of the spindle in degrees. This can be used for any indexing functions.
3. Pulse counter, this is a function of the encoder PPR and wraps around. Threading operations synchronise to this value.

**NOTE**
1. Some lathe functions display diagrams where the stock to be removed is displayed in orange.
2. The origin (0,0) required for turning operations is displayed using a yellow dot.

### Settings

![](images/settings.png)

#### X pulses per MM

X axis stepper / servo pulses per MM. This should include any gear ratios in transmission.

#### Z pulses per MM

Z axis stepper / servo pulses per MM. This should include any gear ratios in tranmission, especially if you're using
the gearbox.

#### X backlash uM

X backlash in microns. You can measure this by using a dial gauge against the cross slide and driving the stepper in
one direction for a full rotation and reversing to measure the amount of distance the stepper has to drive the axis before the
dial gauge indicates movement.

#### Z backlash uM

Z backlash in microns. Measure as above.

#### Spindle encoder PPR

Pulses per one revolution of the spindle. Note, this is usually the actual pulses generated by the encoder times any
gear ratios in drive mechanism. You can drive the encoder at 1.5-2x the speed of the spindle but pay attention to the
maximum RPM rating for the encoder.

#### X retract jog speed mm/s

Speed at which X axis retraction is done, can be slowed or sped up depending on gear / pulley ratios.

#### Z retract jog speed mm/s

Speed at which Z axis retraction is done, can be slowed or sped up depending on gear / pulley ratios.

#### X closed loop

If DRO is connected, then uses a simple closed loop traversal for linear movements on X axis. This can be particularly useful for turning stock to a specific diameter but it will depend on the accuracy of your DRO.

#### Z closed loop

If DRO is connected, then uses a simple closed loop traversal for linear movements on Z axis.

#### X DRO Invert

Invert direction for DRO on X Axis

#### Z DRO Invert

Invert direction for DRO on Z Axis

#### X DIR Invert

Invert stepper direction on X Axis

#### Z DIR Invert

Invert stepper direction on Z Axis


### Manual Turning

**NOTE**

8. Back off tool, jog to Z origin.
9. Feed in tool and press Ready again

![](images/manual-turning.png)

#### F/P

Set feed. The feed rate is independent of the spindle RPM at mm/s.
